410,Ciel Bleu,https://guide.michelin.com/en/noord-holland/amsterdam/restaurant/ciel-bleu,"Ciel Bleu immediately lives up to its name. Here, you dine on the top floor of the luxurious Okura Hotel with a spectacular view of the blue sky and the Amsterdam skyline as a backdrop. The modern elegance of the restaurant and the superlative presentation of the dishes are equally pleasing to the eye.
Arjan Speelman's cuisine is technically accomplished, creative and laced with international influences and seasonings. This chef effortlessly combines a classic beurre blanc with exotic spices and ingredients from around the globe. Every detail is precise, every bite a surprise. A nice touch: with each course, a herb in its original form is brought to the table – this herb will be featured in the next dish.
Dining at Ciel Bleu is intriguing. You will be served by one of the best front-of-house teams in the country, starring sommelier Noël Vanwittenbergh and maître d' Francesco Simonelli.

His food looks as spectacular as it tastes – exciting and colourful with a unique interplay of textures.
First-class Dutch produce and international seasonings come together here in complex dishes. The technically gifted chef does not shy away from contrasts, and he is certainly an innovator rather than an imitator! This applies to his vegetarian set menu as well as to his fish and meat creations. His combination of crispy duck tongue, blue lobster and foie gras with liquorice and green apple is simply amazing. At Spectrum, every bite creates a new impression that increases the desire for more.

In 2013, the popular chef transformed his two-MICHELIN-starred restaurant into this down-to-earth gastrobar, and it was an instant success. This hip urban establishment offers a diverse atmosphere in which to discover chef Blaauw's relaxed fine dining concept.
Eschewing any unnecessary frills, the focus lies squarely on original combinations and distinct flavours. Here, you can enjoy simple yet imaginative cuisine that is intelligent, elaborate and bold. Think veal sweetbreads cooked in time-honoured tradition, a spicy blend of lentils, textures of pumpkin and yoghurt with lime zest for body and freshness. The dishes here are brimming with flavour.
The impressive menu features classics such as beef Wellington, vegetarian options and premium produce such as wagyu and turbot cooked on the barbecue, as well as an amazing onion Martini (with a Comté foam).

2100,Bolenius,https://guide.michelin.com/en/noord-holland/amsterdam/restaurant/bolenius,"Luc Kusters is an ambassador of Dutch cuisine who lays the focus squarely on vegetables and local produce. On a daily basis, he harvests delicious produce from his kitchen garden, located close to the restaurant in the Zuidas business district! Bolenius's elegant minimalist style and urban vibe reflect the purity of the cuisine. The ethos behind this sustainable vision is regularly explained when the kitchen team serve their dishes themselves.
The head chef's ingenuity comes to the fore in the stunning presentation and flavour combinations of his dishes. His cuisine is light but brimming with intensity. He prefers to express himself with vegetables and herbs – beetroot grown in clay soil with morels is a signature dish for good reason – but he also works with meat and fish, eg Dutch Kamper lamb or pike-perch from the North Sea. Whether you opt for his plant-based set menu or the ""Dutch Menu"" (also available à la carte), the versatility and nuances he draws out of treasures from Dutch soil is uncommonly captivating: aromatic cauliflower, green peppers and textures of buckwheat with a clear broth that brings everything together and adds depth. The way chef Kusters turns 'simplicity' into memorable cuisine is truly remarkable.","George Gershwinlaan 30, Amsterdam, 1082 MT, Netherlands",Amsterdam, Netherlands,€€€€,Creative,4.873797,52.3361146,31204044411,https://guide.michelin.com/en/noord-holland/amsterdam/restaurant/bolenius,https://bolenius-restaurant.nl/,1 MICHELIN Star,"American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Terrace,Visa credit card"

The talented chef brings classic culinary know-how, international influences, playfulness and exciting creativity to the table. If you order the Anjou pigeon or the turbot, you can be sure that it will be cooked to perfection and that the sauces will be intense and delicate. The goose liver gratinated with 100% chocolate and served with an almond crème caramel demonstrates that he also masters modern techniques.
The balance between the two is always carefully maintained by Jurgen van der Zalm, who cooks with respect for the work of Dennis Kuipers, who used to be head chef here.
