Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/helene-darroze-at-the-connaught,"Every restaurant needs reinvention from time to time and the new look of Hélène Darroze’s London base shows that The Connaught isn’t afraid of moving forward. The room is now more feminine and less formal, considerably warmer and more relaxing. That being said, there’s still a well-drilled service team on hand to ensure everyone is looked after. 
When it comes to the cooking – created under the watchful eye of Hélène’s head chef – the focus remains steadfastly on the main ingredient; always of extraordinary quality, be it lobster from Cornwall or grouse from Wales. The accompanying flavours, including occasional international influences, are used to enhance or italicise it and this results in dishes that stay long in the memory. The signature Baba dessert with a choice of Armagnacs aged by her brother Marc is a must.","Carlos Place, London, W1K 2AL, United Kingdom",London, United Kingdom,££££,Modern Cuisine,-0.1492905,51.510188,4.42031E+11,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/helene-darroze-at-the-connaught,https://www.the-connaught.co.uk/restaurants-bars/helene-darroze-at-the-connaught/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Booking essential,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Diners Club credit card,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Visa credit card"

The menu is a roll-call of refined, sophisticated French classics that delight and satisfy in equal measure – the soufflé Suissesse is renowned and luxury items lead the way, with the likes of coquilles St Jacques, turbot and lobster; if it all sounds so good that you simply can’t decide, go for the ‘Menu Exceptionnel’.

If you come at lunchtime for the great dim sum you’ll wonder why you ever go anywhere else at midday.

Claude Bosi’s cooking shows a man proud of his French heritage and confident of his abilities. His dishes are poised and well-balanced with bold, assured flavours. Choose between the à la carte and two tasting menus: ‘Our Classics’ includes the likes of ‘turbot à la Grenobloise’, while ‘Tastes of the Season’ offers bolder, more creative combinations.

Brat takes its inspiration from the cooking styles found in the Basque country, which means that cooking over fire is the focal point in every way. 
The restaurant’s name is the Old English word for turbot and this is the house speciality, designed for sharing: it’s grilled whole in a handmade basket over lump wood charcoal and the sauce is made from the released collagen and gelatine.

Seven Park Place,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/seven-park-place,"Having been extended and enlarged, Seven Park Place may no longer be the tiny jewel box it once was, but it can still provide a discreet and intimate dining experience for those wanting a little peace and tranquillity when it comes to dining out. One bonus is that you no longer have to breathe in to sidle past the bar stools to reach it as it now has a more welcoming entrance within St James’s Hotel and Club. 
What hasn’t changed is the reassuring presence of William Drabble in the kitchen – and it’s a rare night he’s not here at the stove. He’s a classically-trained chef who instinctively knows what goes with what, so instead of trying to reinvent the wheel he concentrates on sourcing the best British ingredients in season and then gives them the space to allow their natural flavours to shine.","7-8 Park Place, London, SW1A 1LS, United Kingdom",London, United Kingdom,££££,Modern Cuisine,-0.1402288,51.5061901,4.42073E+11,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/seven-park-place,https://www.stjameshotelandclub.com/en,1 MICHELIN Star,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Booking essential,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Visa credit card"

The Tasting Menus read like a culinary journey of reminiscences, where each well-judged and sophisticated dish relates to something memorable from the past, whether that was climbing a tree or enjoying the last barbecue of summer.

The base is largely classical French but with British and Mediterranean influences – this is a kitchen where things are done the traditional way.

The menu is British to the core and the owners supply much of the deer and game, while their roof garden supplies tomatoes, radishes and strawberries. Menus evolve throughout the year and the produce used is at its peak: this in turn allows the kitchen to keep things simple and allow the main ingredient to shine.

Once you’ve rocked the red carpet on the pavement outside, you’re greeted at the foot of the stairs before being escorted up past the flower-filled pool and busy bar into the cleverly textured restaurant – you won’t even notice the lack of windows.

Wild Honey St James,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/wild-honey-st-james,"Ever since his days at the much-mourned Arbutus, Anthony Demetre’s cooking has been defined by a refreshing lack of pomposity and showmanship. For him, it’s all about the flavours, not the frippery – so while his dishes might look quite simple on the plate, they really deliver in taste and thus reveal his considerable skills. His European menu is hugely appealing, as he regularly brings in new dishes to complement his specialities like crisp chicken with hand-cut macaroni, and his wonderful custard tart. 
This brasserie de-luxe may be part of the Sofitel London St James hotel but feels a wholly separate, stand-alone entity, especially as it has its own entrance on Pall Mall.

This results in a varied and imaginative set menu of colourful, vibrant dishes that have you gripped from the first bite to the last. Tostadas, whether with chalk stream trout or salt-baked beetroot, are a highlight, as are the generous, family-style dishes like succulent pulpo or melt-in-the-mouth pork cheeks.

It is also a restaurant that seems happy in Chiswick and never gives the impression it would prefer to be in Mayfair; the locals repay the compliment by creating a warm, relaxed atmosphere. 
The menu changes twice a day and there’s little difference between the style of dishes served at lunch and dinner. The set price menu is balanced and appealing and, while the influences are varied, its heart is French with occasional nods to the Mediterranean.

The other reason for its enduring popularity is the great food and the consistency that the kitchen maintains. The hugely appealing menu covers many regions of Italy and provides plenty of choice – including some terrific pasta dishes.

Daily written menus burst with authentic Italian flavours which make one’s mouth water in anticipation.

Pied à Terre,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/pied-a-terre,"Over the last quarter of a century, few London streets have seen more restaurants come and go than Charlotte Street, but one constant over that period has been David Moore’s Pied à Terre. One of the reasons for its longevity has been its subtle reinventions: nothing ever too grandiose – just a little freshening up with a new colour scheme or some clever lighting to keep the place looking relevant and vibrant. 
Of course, the restaurant’s success is also due to its cooking, and there’s been reinvigoration here, too, with the introduction of a vegan menu. Dishes are based on classical French techniques with occasional nods to the chef’s Greek background, which give the cooking a bold, muscular edge. The room is undeniably intimate and the professional, thoughtful service goes a long way in ensuring the atmosphere remains serene and welcoming.","34 Charlotte Street, London, W1T 2NH, United Kingdom",London, United Kingdom,££££,Creative,-0.1352265,51.5191109,4.42076E+11,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/pied-a-terre,https://www.pied-a-terre.co.uk/,1 MICHELIN Star,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Booking essential,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Visa credit card"

Welcome to Leroy, which manages to achieve what many other restaurants can only aspire to, by delivering a personal dining experience in a laid-back atmosphere.
Menus change throughout the week according to the best seasonal produce available. Deeply flavoured modern dishes might include burrata, pumpkin raviolo or rabbit Wellington, followed by Normandy apple tart or soft chocolate ganache – and the pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan options are much more than just an afterthought.

Pollen Street Social,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/pollen-street-social,"Jason Atherton’s empire now covers the globe but Mayfair’s Pollen Street Social is a special place because it’s here at his flagship that it all began. He used lockdown as an opportunity to develop his ideas and when he relaunched, it was with a new style and a new concept.
The smart bar is a place for pre-meal drinks and snacks; well-spaced tables provide a feeling of luxury and elegance; and there’s a chef’s counter where you can watch the team prepare your premium tasting menu. Top-notch British produce is used in unfussy modern dishes with a classic heart and the occasional playful touch, and strong, punchy flavours shine through. The dishes are often finished at the table with a flourish, while the well-drilled serving team explain their make-up.

A table near the back beside the tropical fish tank is a great place to sit, with the basement more suited to a romantic date – and service is engaging and highly attentive. The wine list includes some interesting Chinese options and is well worth a look.
All areas of China are represented on the wide-ranging menus, with an emphasis on the southern Nanyang region. 20% of the dishes are classics, such as the powerfully flavoured 18-hour slow-cooked pork belly; the other 80% are more elaborate, adventurous constructions like spring chicken and Szechuan spicy crumble. Vegetarians are well looked after and desserts are a highlight.

There’s little distraction from the surroundings either, which come in a shade of detention centre white.
This is the place to try new flavours, whether that’s cuttlefish or ox tongue. Game is a favourite and the only gravy will be the blood of the bird – this is natural, ‘proper’ food. Seasonality is at its core – the menu is rewritten for each service – and nothing sums up the philosophy more than the potatoes and greens: they are always on the menu but the varieties and types change regularly. The waiters spend time in the kitchen so they know what they’re talking about and are worth listening to. There are dishes for two as well as magnums of wine for real trenchermen.

Portland,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/portland,"The cooking at Portland respects the principles of sourcing and seasonality; in fact, the menu is often reprinted after lunch as ingredients are used up and replaced by different ones. The kitchen believes in doing as little as possible to the raw ingredients to allow their natural flavours to come through, and plates are never over-crowded, with every component there to enhance another. Be sure to try the bread flavoured with treacle and porter, which is stunning.
The pared-down look of the room is just the right side of austere, helped along by the chefs on display in the open kitchen, some original art on the walls, and a knowledgeable service team who are happy to make recommendations.

Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/petrus284688,"Named after the famous Pomerol wine estate in Bordeaux, which produces superlative wine from 100% Merlot vines, Pétrus serves both as a neighbourhood restaurant for the well-to-do locals and a place for lesser mortals to get glammed up and celebrate a special occasion. At the heart of the elegant room is its striking glass-walled wine store, which features over 700 bins, including Château Pétrus going back to 1948; red walls and roses further emphasize the theme.
Cooking has a classic French heart, with the Ramsay hallmarks of modernity and unfussy execution; sauces deliver great depth, textural contrasts play an important part, and dishes exhibit consummate balance and seasoning.

It doesn’t seem to matter whether you’re here in a group or on a date, as it's the type of restaurant that can accommodate every customer – and it's certainly worth arriving early for a cocktail or two in the bar.
The Cantonese specialities are prepared with care and consistency and dishes are strong on presentation.

This is Adam Handling’s flagship restaurant, and its fresh, clean look keeps the focus firmly on the food: to the front is the main kitchen and to the side, the counter where they prepare the desserts.
Adam Handling started cooking when he was very young and a passion for the profession clearly runs through his DNA. His set menus are founded on classical techniques but he blends them with playfulness and originality to produce colourful, well-crafted dishes which are beautiful to look at. The signature bread served with chicken skin butter and liver pâté has a backstory linked to his sister, who would only eat roast chicken for Sunday lunch.

However, the undoubted star of the show is a version of the dish made famous by the original Trishna in Mumbai: brown crab, in this case from Dorset, with lots of butter and a kick of red chilli; it is so wondrously rich you’ll be licking your lips for days afterwards.

Trinity,https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/trinity,"The joy of genuine neighbourhood restaurants is that customers are treated less like numbers and their opinions are more likely to be listened to by the chefs. This is certainly true at this keenly run Clapham restaurant, which has built its reputation on giving the locals exactly what they want.
The kitchen wisely avoids reinventing the wheel and its strength is taking just a few prime seasonal ingredients and skilfully turning them into memorable dishes comprising rich layers of flavour. Cooking focuses on classical techniques and tried-and-tested flavour combinations – for dessert, the tarte Tatin or salted caramel tart is a must.

There are three distinct areas: on the ground floor is the bar and opposite, a counter serving tapas from all over Spain. Upstairs is El Asador, the only area for which bookings are taken; here you sit at communal tables enjoying specialities from Galicia and Castile.

Both dining areas offer delicate, immaculately crafted dishes which brim with seasonality and natural flavours; the former focuses on two tasting menus – across which Executive Chef Olly Dabbous’ influence is clearly stamped – and the latter opens early to offer a breakfast menu.

Raw dishes compete with those that are cooked – and there’s often more to combinations than first meets the eye.

Chef Victor Garvey was born to a French-Spanish mother and an American father, and spent time working in both Spain and the US. His modern Californian cooking uses first-rate ingredients and the well-balanced dishes are characterised by deep, bold flavours and punchy sauces.
