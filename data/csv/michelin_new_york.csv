55,Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/chef-s-table-at-brooklyn-fare,"Wandering the aisles of a supermarket in search of the entrance merely adds to the feeling of discovery. There are tables but sitting at the walnut counter watching the team is an integral part of the experience. Everyone is served at once by a smart black-suited team who prove that when service is really good, you barely notice it.
Chef César Ramirez’s cooking is an almost subtractive form of cuisine. The 13 or so small but perfectly formed dishes confirm a chef at the height of his powers. Nothing is showy or extraneous here. It’s just an absolute meticulousness in ensuring that the key ingredient, whether that’s a Scottish langoustine or A5 Wagyu beef from Miyazaki, delivers its true essence. The sauces, which are of extraordinary depth, also play their part.","431 W. 37th St., New York, 10018, USA",New York, USA,$$$$,Contemporary,-73.9964997,40.7560823,17182430050,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/chef-s-table-at-brooklyn-fare,https://www.brooklynfare.com/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,Counter dining,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Particularly interesting wine list,Wheelchair access"
56,Per Se,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/per-se,"An experience at Thomas Keller’s Per Se is one to be savored, recounted and remembered. Despite stellar views and a clever design allowing each table a view, your attention won’t stray from the plate. Such is the appeal of the place.
There are two menus, one of which is vegetarian and may highlight a playful twist on borscht, with red beet agnolotti and crème fraîche. Both menus end in a grand dessert finale, like seasonal confections as well as such classics as a cappuccino semifreddo served with brioche donuts. They do offer supplements using lavish ingredients, but unless you’re richer than Croesus, you needn’t consider them. Just put yourself in the chef's hands and relish a meal that is balanced, varied and as seasonal as it gets.","10 Columbus Circle, New York, 10019, USA",New York, USA,$$$$,"Contemporary, French",-73.9825882,40.7680545,12128239335,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/per-se,https://www.thomaskeller.com/perseny,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"
57,Le Bernardin,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/le-bernardin,"When the definitive history of NYC's dining scene is written, Le Bernardin will have a chapter all to itself. Maguy Le Coze and Eric Ripert’s icon has been entertaining the city’s movers and shakers for over 20 years and its popularity remains undimmed.
As soon as you step inside you are enveloped in a warm embrace. Lunch is busy with those who know what they want and trust this well-oiled machine to deliver it in the time they have. Come at dinner for a more languid affair. The menu is divided into headings of “Almost raw,” “Barely touched” and “Lightly cooked,” but don’t be fooled, these product-driven items have considerable depth. Seafood restaurants have no hiding place when it comes to cooking fish or crustaceans and this kitchen always hits its marks—whether that’s poaching halibut, pan-roasting monkfish, baking striped bass or searing tuna.
While seafood remains Ripert's passion, his vegetarian tasting menu makes waves with dishes like the Himalayan morel, spring pea and fava bean casserole or the warm artichoke panaché with vegetable risotto and Périgord black truffle vinaigrette. Bid this spread adieu over coconut mousse with shavings of caramelized pineapple.","155 W. 51st St., New York, 10019, USA",New York, USA,$$$$,Seafood,-73.98223,40.76177,12125541515,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/le-bernardin,https://www.le-bernardin.com/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"
58,Masa,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/masa,"To taste what may be the continent’s best sushi, experience the contemplative and very exclusive ceremony of Chef Masa Takayama’s omakase. Everything here carries a certain weight, from the heavy wooden door to the bill. 
Attention to detail is unsurpassed and at times it may seem like a bit much, but a reverential spirit is part of your meal here. Service displays the same smooth grace, with servers at the ready.
Awaken the palate with a sweet chunk of hairy crab meat dressed in citrusy yuzu beneath creamy tomalley. This may be followed by the chef’s signature glass coupe of minced toro and a very fine—and generous—pile of Osetra caviar. Maine uni is wondrous, served in its shell with caramelized custard and paper-thin white truffle.","10 Columbus Circle, New York, 10019, USA",New York, USA,$$$$,"Japanese, Sushi",-73.98234,40.76819,12128239800,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/masa,https://www.masanyc.com/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,Counter dining,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Notable sake list,Wheelchair access"
59,Eleven Madison Park,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/eleven-madison-park,"Chef Daniel Humm presides over this temple of modern elegance with a zealous dedication to masterful precision. Nothing is out of place and everything is custom made, from the staff’s suits to the handblown water vases.
The plant-based menu is a bold vision of luxury dining. The freshly baked, delicately crisped vegan roll presented with faux butter is a magical creation. A quenelle of tonburi, mimicking caviar, plated with horseradish cream and accompanied by a radish tostada with a swipe of pumpkin seed butter is simply stunning. Toothsome braised seitan, wrapped in spinach and dressed with morels, is amplified with luscious sauce work. 
Desserts, perhaps a frozen cherry blossom and rose confection dressed with strawberries, are equally accomplished.","11 Madison Ave., New York, 10010, USA",New York, USA,$$$$,"Contemporary, Innovative",-73.9872414,40.7415543,12128890905,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/eleven-madison-park,https://www.elevenmadisonpark.com/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"

Like walking through Business on your way to First Class, you have to pass through buzzy Nougatine to get here. Low-slung chairs and large tables mean you need a certain confidence in your conversational delivery if you wish to entertain the whole table.
Dishes showcase everything from attention to detail and impeccable products to thoughtful garnishes and nuanced flavors. The omnivore menu is also appealingly versatile thanks to contemporary accents and classic techniques.

327,Jungsik,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/jungsik,"Jungsik's ""New Korean"" cuisine leans westwards. Indeed, some of this kitchen's wonderful sauces wouldn’t be out of place at a grand French table, but what is most impressive here is that the Korean elements of the dishes seem to raise them to another level. Bibimbap composed with gochujang, crispy quinoa and tender Wagyu beef tartare will live long in the memory; while the branzino served simply with white kimchi shows that this is also a kitchen with the utmost confidence in the quality of its ingredients.
This is cooking that is original, impeccably executed and enormously satisfying. It’s the sort of food that makes you involuntarily nod to yourself while you’re eating. The space is cool, crisp and elegant; the service team sharp, keen and organized.","2 Harrison St., New York, 10013, USA",New York, USA,$$$$,"Korean, Contemporary",-74.00911,40.718685,12122190900,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/jungsik,https://www.jungsik.com/,2 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Particularly interesting wine list,Wheelchair access"
328,The Modern,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/the-modern,"The Modern is designed to capture the iconic feel of the MoMA in which it is housed. Art enthusiasts can't help ogling at its glorious surrounds; while excellent acoustics facilitating quiet conversations ensure a steady stream of couples and globe-trotters. The kitchen is state of the art, so for a truly special experience book the chef's table inside. The staff perform a veritable ballet as they present diners with such appealingly nuanced dishes as a seed cracker with aged cheddar and butternut squash butter; or eggs on eggs, starring none other than soft-boiled eggs with sturgeon caviar. Turbot roasted on the bone may then arrive alongside rich parmesan cream.

329,Ko,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/ko,"Ko has been the pride and joy of David Chang's culinary empire. Open since 2014 and tucked into an East Village alley, it begins a new chapter under the stewardship of Chef Esther Ha. Some things remain unchanged, like the upbeat soundtrack, sleek counter staged around a kitchen with nowhere to hide and a vibe so relaxed that diners might even sing along.
Favored dishes, like the chickpea hozon with sea urchin, are still here and still excellent. Chef Ha  carries the torch forward though, bringing new ideas to the fore—aged strip loin with onion béarnaise and aged cheddar is a cheeky twist on the cheeseburger. Smoked onion soufflé is exemplary, while bonito ice cream with sweet potato skins reflects a bold brand of cooking—a cornerstone of this kitchen.","8 Extra Pl., New York, 10003, USA",New York, USA,$$$$,Contemporary,-73.9916056,40.7246476,12125000831,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/ko,https://momofuku.com/,2 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,Counter dining,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Particularly interesting wine list,Terrace"

Dishes reflect global sensibilities with a strong creative edge, as in the langoustine tartare topped with a crispy tuile and enriched with cauliflower cream. Foie gras arrives in myriad guises, perhaps as a seared lobe as rich as custard, surrounded by roasted quince, chestnuts and vanilla gastrique. Old-school luxuries extend right through to the cheese trolley. The cocktail list is dedicated to the history of Bryant Park across the street, while as an homage to the eponymous chef’s Alsatian heritage, the wine selection prominently features rieslings, pinot blancs and gewürztraminers.","41 W. 42nd St., New York, 10036, USA",New York, USA,$$$$,"Contemporary, Alsatian",-73.982025,40.75397,12122575826,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/gabriel-kreuther,https://www.gknyc.com/,2 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"

Enjoy the eponymous infused spirit along with bites from one of two tasting menus. Expect glazed earthenware, slate platters and wooden boxes cradling the likes of a medallion of North Sea cod, torched ever so slightly, and accompanied by a light-textured mussel foam and petite wedges of roasted red endive. Lean and tender duck breast sided by a petite block of compressed leg meat is dressed tableside with a beet sauce enriched with duck jus.

Chef Fredrik Berselius and his ace team delight diners with their highly accomplished Nordic cuisine. Local products are woven in to the seasonal tasting, and items like prawn shells and venison bones are transformed into luscious sauces that enhance each plating. Dinner is sure to start on a high note, when Danish kingfish crudo crowned by a dollop of Osetra caviar and dressed with a gooseberry and juniper oil vinaigrette is set on the table.

Danish chef Ronny Emborg and team serve up a menu of courses that progress from light and subtle to rich and robust. Things are certainly grown-up here, with such fully realized dishes as a rye cracker piped with ham and topped with crisped chicken skin; or a potato dumpling smartly dressed with parmesan foam. Paper-thin Wagyu shavings may then be enhanced with a pour of hot dried shrimp bouillon and confit quail egg yolk.

This team continues to push the boundaries of modern Korean cooking and even the most seasoned diners are in for a surprise.  Dishes are delicate, yet satisfying and display extraordinary finesse. Mastery of technique and depth of flavor are plain as day in the likes of striped beakfish fragrant with black truffle and Yangha ginger; or shrimp with eggplant, tomato gel and salmon roe. In a simple stroke of genius, hibiscus tea-panna cotta arrives with a crown of huckleberry ice.

Chef James Kent never allows his cuisine to be overshadowed by the setting, however. Along with his talented team, he presents diners with compositions that embrace luxury and urbane inspiration.

Al Coro pours on the drama with old world glamour and live music. The buzzy dining room sets the stage for a kitchen that dances behind the curtain, reveling in the unexpected and sidestepping tradition for the fixed modern Italian menu. A meal here begins with an assortment of antipasti, including smoked ricotta and carrot sformato, and it's clear from those first few bites that this will be an experience to treasure. Pastas are a highlight, with diners choosing from such delights as culurgiones, or Sardinian dumplings.

The progression of the these whimsical, seasonal courses is strategic and imaginative. To start, chilled caviar with warm scrambled eggs and potato purée. Up next, chopped scallop matched with sea buckthorn sauce and a nori crisp for crunch.

Named for the town in Nara Prefecture where his father hails, there is a precise quality to every facet of this space—as in the hinoki counter (sourced from a 300-year-old tree) and hand-made chairs to the knives crafted by a master from Saga Prefecture.
This meticulous approach is seen again in the presentation of dishes. Meals bring an element of theater, so much so that diners will find themselves leaning forward to absorb every detail—envision the dramatic removal of a glass dome to reveal a perfect piece of smoked salmon.

There are just 18 counter seats and a table for six, but the size only adds to its exclusivity. Watch as the crew plates contemporary French dishes with a keen eye toward texture. Plump sea urchin with chopped razor clams is fragrant and tender; slow-cooked chicken with a meaty handmade ravioli in black ink sauce is daring.

Inside, Executive Chef Hideo An may be found working his skills like a master pianist—turning, fanning, saucing and brushing. It's a pristine workspace and the menu is a tribute to the yakitori tradition. Binchotan charcoal plays as vital a role as the fowl itself, with the aroma becoming one with the space and skewer.
Chilled kombu-poached chicken is a succulent first bite. Vegetables, too, get their due—as in charred cipollini onion or agedashi tofu.

The open kitchen is a true-to-life stage for this team, who can be seen prepping, cooking, and putting the finishing touches on a series of gratifying plates. To start, a soufflé cake topped with caviar-crested seaweed butter that's replete with umami flavor; or butternut squash bomboloni oozing with cheese and packed with pancetta. An earnest, delicate, and expert hand is clearly at work behind the pasta (rigatoni dressed with sweet and meaty Calabrian pumpkin and savory Italian sausage); while a flaky and golden pithivier filled with minced vegetables, lentils, and greens gets a masterful stroke of lush hazelnut curry.

While the menu feels like an American story as told through an Italian lens, Asian elements also make guest appearances as in the spicy pepperoni fried rice gussied-up with tender grilled calamari. Playful aptly describes the combination of spicy veal tartare and tuna carpaccio. Pastas are similarly prolific, like the paprika-tinted sopressin with smoked mussels or sourdough pasta in a 'Nduja sauce with mezcal-braised chicken.

Beet carpaccio with horseradish and pecorino is a superb effort, while carrot marinara pizza with carrot pepperoni is spellbinding.

Omakase is profoundly personal, as each morsel arrives in cupped hands to be enjoyed with your fingers. Enjoy bites such as a fresh fig wtih sesame sauce or a piece of corn cut off the cob with tempura-style mochi. Pieces are precise in that traditional Edomae style.

In fact, the cityscape views are so spectacular, the ordering of a Manhattan as your pre-prandial cocktail seems the only obvious choice.
The entire place also oozes romance. A regiment of experienced, white-jacketed waitstaff keep the whole operation ticking along like the well-oiled machine it is—and they can probably spot an impending marriage proposal even before the potential groom has left his seat.
However, don’t come thinking that the food here will be playing second fiddle to the stellar views. In fact, it provides the perfect match for the setting. The ingredients are top-notch and the kitchen team has an inherent understanding of what goes with what—imagine succulent pork belly with scallops for example, or even glistening duck breast with sweet potato spätzle.

Oxomoco is a serious dining room, capable of great things in its wood-fired oven. The attractive interior feels like a resort, with a long bar, giant skylight to maximize the sunlight of such a narrow space, and outdoor patio. The room is lively and packed but always conducive to conversation.
Tacos are the main draw, especially when piled with the likes of tender flank steak or soft-shell crab. However, this kitchen team doesn’t stick to merely one dish or area of Mexico. Instead, they reach widely across a myriad of regions, always balancing abundance with fresh and vibrant flavors. The menu thereby tempts and tantalizes with such large and small items as the tropical hamachi agua chile and tlayuda crafted from smoky corn on a shell. Other standouts include the brined, fried and smoked “giant chicken.""
Apprised diners know never to pass up on creative and clever delicacies like the hoja santa curd, accompanied by roasted strawberries, raspberry granita, and finished with spicy olive oil.

First-timers should go for the “Butcher’s Feast” featuring different cuts of beef, an egg soufflé, and enough banchan to cover your table.

The menu is unapologetically French, though Chef Daniel Rose infuses his classics with a strong dose of personality. A selection of “gourmandises” showcases such exemplary classics as pike quenelles or sautéed sweetbreads, which achieve prominent flavor when paired with tomato crème. This may be tailed by beef cheek and foie gras terrine in a pitch-perfect sherry vinaigrette.

Chef Sungchul Shim taps into his Korean roots and fine-dining pedigree to create a solid but playful menu. Start with sweet potato and sunchoke gratin paired with a clever doenjang béchamel, then salmon bibimbap, mingling pollock roe, candied anchovy and toasted nori with brown soy-butter rice, is a harmonious high point.

Here at the small but perfectly formed Casa Mono, dishes are none of those one-bite wonders that blight so many places these days. Nor do they arrive in a stampede at your table. Instead, they are sent out in a sensible order, for the benefit of the diner rather than the convenience of the kitchen.
The cuisine is nominally influenced by the Costa Brava, but its reach is far greater than that and the tapas are especially refined.

Some counters like to keep everyone in sync, but Chef Kousaka is more flexible. It is certainly a rigorous balancing act, but he moves with confidence and skill. Fish is minimally embellished, relying instead on original sourcing and impeccable technique.

From lush hamachi with shiso pepper-saturated Meyer lemon curd to juicy-crispy chicken roulade over a puree of miso and spicy mole, this kitchen team treats its top-quality ingredients with refined techniques.

The young Chef Mitsunobu Nagae is a calm, collected presence in the open kitchen, and years spent working at Joël Robuchon restaurants worldwide are evident. A harmonious union of French cooking with Japanese sensibilities, Nagae’s food is immediately approachable.

Glistening planks of Ora King salmon; tender strips of cured mackerel; and melting slabs of pork belly marinated with ssamjang are placed on beds of rice cradled in seaweed.

One bite in and you'll quickly learn that this cooking is all heart. Dishes are spicy, but the heat is used as elegantly as it is liberally. Start with the mulaikattiya thaniyam, the chef's childhood snack that bursts with flavor.

Standing in line gives you time to think about your order. Just be sure it includes brisket, pulled pork and beef ribs. A side of collard greens simply enhances the feast. Fat, considered by some a bad word, is what gives the meat its succulence and soft texture, as does the crust of salt, pepper, and turbinado sugar.

The uninitiated come for the crab Rangoon, General Tso’s chicken, and other American treasures; but those in the know come for crave-worthy Sichuan food.
Start with the spicy mung bean jelly noodles and Sichuan-style crispy eggplant, which is not the least bit greasy and sports a creamy center and glass-like crust. Thin shavings of intensely smoked pork with garlic leaf is even better than what tea-smoked duck would taste like if made with bacon.

Fried momos may feature a range of fillings, but go with the beef paired with pickled vegetables for a greaseless, yet crispy treat.

Elmhurst is rich with talented Thai kitchens, but this one stands out for its fiery Isan-style cooking and prowess with seafood. It would be a mistake to show up without friends – or at least a very serious appetite. Dried shrimp and electric fish sauces are used with abandon on a menu that demands roaming. The house special larb ped udon pulls no punches with duck breast and fried duck skin jolted with fried lime leaves, mint, fried garlic and lime juice. Fried whole fish and bubbling hot pots tempt alongside excellent mainstays like prawn pad Thai and rotisserie chicken marinated in coriander and lemongrass.","76-04 Woodside Ave., New York, 11373, USA",New York, USA,$$,"Thai, Isan",-73.8887392,40.7433172,16315261664,https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/zaab-zaab,,Bib Gourmand,"Air conditioning,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Terrace"

A refined tonkotsu is the house favorite but the smoked dashi ramen holds its own. All noodles are made in-house and boast proper spring and bounce. Starters also flaunt refinement, including the crisp-seared gyoza packed with pork, ginger, and set in a cast-iron pan sizzling with ramen broth. For something lighter but equally heartwarming, go for the kale salad dressed with an umami-packed vinaigrette and garnished with sweet pomegranate and grapefruit segments. Finish with mango milk shaved ice topped with a dollop of honey cream.

A native of Peru, Chef Claudia Berroa follows a preservative-free dictum, so diners may expect a plethora of local and organic flavors.

But unlike its neighbors, which stick to a single specialty like Sichuan and soup dumplings, Jiang Nan delivers hits from all regions of China. The roast Beijing duck is a signature order that comes with thin pancakes on a silver tray. Fiery mapo tofu in a portion fit for four and one particularly thrilling sliced beef in golden pepper sauce are must-orders.
