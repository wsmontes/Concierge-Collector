84,Le Pré Catelan,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/le-pre-catelan,"Pierre-Yves Rochon is credited with revolutionising this Napoleon III lodge nestled in the Bois de Boulogne, with its designer furniture and palette of green, white and silver tones. At the helm of this illustrious house is a Meilleur Ouvrier de France with an undiminished passion: Frédéric Anton. From his mentors (who include Joël Robuchon), the chef has inherited precision and rigour, to which he has added his own distinct taste for original combinations of flavours. Often centred on an ingredient of choice (red mullet, morel, squab, langoustine), the dishes combine balance, harmony and generosity: each one is a gem, down to its design on the plate. Let's not forget, of course, the prestigious wine cellar and perfect service.","Route de Suresnes - bois de Boulogne, Paris, 75016, France",Paris, France,€€€€,"Creative, Modern Cuisine",2.2507182,48.8639374,33144144114,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/le-pre-catelan,https://www.leprecatelan.com/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Car park,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Diners Club credit card,Garden or park,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Valet parking,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"

It is the very epitome of the great French restaurant: the luxurious setting, the culture of beautifully dressed tables, the seamlessly orchestrated service – it all makes for a unique backdrop, fit to showcase gastronomy in all its glory. Chef Yannick Alléno has achieved a real tour de force by stamping his hallmark on the menu from the outset. His cuisine is dazzling and technical, and his jus and sauces (what the chef calls ""the verb of French cuisine""), enhanced by skilful extractions, deserve a special mention. This is what happens when the avant-garde puts itself at the service of the great French culinary tradition.","8 avenue Dutuit, Paris, 75008, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Creative,2.3164993,48.8660932,33153051000,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/alleno-paris-au-pavillon-ledoyen,https://www.yannick-alleno.com,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Car park,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Valet parking,Visa credit card"
86,Arpège,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/arpege,"""The best cookbook ever written was by Mother Nature herself,"" according to Alain Passard. His name is associated with vegetables – and, for those in the know, a certain beetroot in a salt crust. He called it before anyone else with his 100% vegetable-based menu, initially considered radical. Nowadays, his green philosophy is de rigueur at every restaurant. Despite his success, the chef who fetes fruit and flowers never feels more at home than when in one of his three kitchen gardens in the west of France, where his twin vocations of cook and gardener meet. He heads there for inspiration, exploring the culinary possibilities of vegetables in a bid to elevate this ordinary ingredient so often relegated to the status of a side dish. A bucolic fresco now references this environment in the restaurant's dining room.","84 rue de Varenne, Paris, 75007, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Creative,2.3169648,48.855731,33147050906,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/arpege,https://www.alain-passard.com/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Visa credit card"

This premium hotel has chosen to name its restaurant after Epicurus: the Greek philosopher who believed in pleasure in temperance, a motto that suits chef Éric Frechon down to the ground: ""My grandfather grew vegetables, my father sold them, I cook them.""

Wholly committed, he pops in and out of the kitchen to share his passion with diners. His new spin on classical cuisine takes you on a voyage between Normandy, his place of birth, and the Mediterranean, his home of adoption and the Paris region… It is impossible not to be bowled over by his work, from its delicacy and generosity to the exceptional quality of the ingredients. This virtuoso sauce maker, who can be compared with a perfume “nose” or an oenologist, lavishes phenomenal care and attention over his jus, dressings and sauces which should be tasted first to better appreciate the complex aromatic universe of each dish. When it comes to the sweet course, he can count on Maxime Frédéric, previously of the George V, to take the desserts to a whole new dimension.

It is here, in one of the most prestigious luxury hotels of Paris, that chef Christian Le Squer works his magic year after year, earning our greatest respect. His timeless cuisine, ever at the service of outstanding produce, unveils his virtuoso technique and phenomenal delicacy, illustrated by a foaming vin jaune-flavoured butter sauce served with lobster or the delicate cream of cauliflower that flanks sea urchin roe. This lad from Morbihan never ceases to pay tribute to his native Brittany in the heart of Paris, celebrating the region with ingredients like soured milk served with caviar and seabass or salted butter with lobster. On the dessert side, pastry wizard Michaël Bartocetti composes a high-flying score inspired by nature, forgoing sugar in favour of fruit and honey. Finally, the service under the auspices of Eric Baumard (also an outstanding sommelier) is a model of empathy and style that is close to perfection.","Four Seasons George V, 31 avenue George-V, Paris, 75008, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Modern Cuisine,2.3008612,48.8687604,33149527154,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/le-cinq6102,https://www.fourseasons.com/paris/dining/restaurants/le_cinq/?seo=google_local_par2_emea,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Diners Club credit card,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Valet parking,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"
92,Kei,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/kei,"""Kei"" is Kei Kobayashi, a chef born in the Japanese city of Nagano who trained in the prestigious kitchens of three-starred chefs Gilles Goujon (L'Auberge du Vieux Puits, Fontjoncouse) and Alain Ducasse (Plaza Athénée, Paris). His father was a cook in a traditional kaiseki restaurant (where special meals composed of a series of small courses are served – akin to Western haute cuisine), but it was while watching a documentary on French cuisine that his vocation truly became clear. Today, his work verges on perfection: a virtuoso of flavour combinations, always spot on when it comes to presentation on the plate, he gives pride of place to high-quality ingredients. For example, Wagyu beef from Kagoshima (the southernmost part of Kyushu Island) –superbly marbled, with a plump, melt-in-the-mouth quality and a smoky and nutty taste, accompanied by beautiful pan-fried gnocchi. Poised to round off your meal in style, pastry chef Toshiya Takatsuka also likes to dabble in far-flung flavours, with his sweet creations reaching the zenith of true refinement.","5 rue du Coq-Héron, Paris, 75001, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Modern Cuisine,2.3422847,48.8643947,33142331474,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/kei,https://www.restaurant-kei.fr/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Visa credit card"

Named best chef in the world by his peers in 2015, he creates a cuisine d'auteur that is exploratory, comprehensive and excessive. This great lover of jazz and contemporary art never rests on his laurels. Gagnaire's restaurant, which has had three stars since 1996, is made in his image: modern and unfussy, striking a chord of discreet refinement, in perfect harmony with the attentive and delicate service. The poetic dishes are constantly being reinvented, like so many small ""satellite"" portions sent into orbit by the chef, making it impossible to cite an emblematic dish, or even a main characteristic – beyond excellence.","6 rue Balzac, Paris, 75008, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Creative,2.3003862,48.8732506,33158361250,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/pierre-gagnaire6112,https://pierregagnaire.com/restaurants/pierre_gagnaire,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Valet parking,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"
110,L'Ambroisie,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/l-ambroisie,"What to say of the creations of Bernard Pacaud, the quality of which is matched only by his modesty? He doesn't give much away, preferring to let his cooking do the talking. His restaurant occupies a townhouse on the Place des Vosges (antique mirrors, immense tapestry, black and white marble floor), which for all its almost Florentine majesty has just undergone extensive refurbishments (including the addition of remarkable contemporary wall panels lit by red diodes). He never ceases to amaze us with his consistency and that je ne sais quoi that comes from the soul and that he is always able to introduce into his work. His dishes may appear to be simple, but each element is placed with absolute conviction, as in a master's painting. Just let yourself be swept along: emotion shines through in every dish – lobster fricassee with civet sauce and Saint-Germain mousseline; scallops with leek, potato and truffle; tarte fine sablée with bitter cocoa and vanilla ice cream.","9 place des Vosges, Paris, 75004, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Classic Cuisine,2.3645215,48.855494,33142785145,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/l-ambroisie,https://www.ambroisie-paris.com/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Visa credit card"
111,Guy Savoy,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/guy-savoy,"In the exceptional setting that is the Hôtel de la Monnaie, Guy Savoy writes a daily new chapter in a story that began a few decades ago. Back then, as a young boy, he would peek into the pans in the kitchen of his family's restaurant, La Buvette de l'Esplanade, in Bourgoin-Jallieu. Now in Paris, he has really gone up a gear, with six dining rooms adorned with contemporary paintings and sculptures (many lent by François Pinault) and windows with old-style frames overlooking the Seine. The splendour of the surroundings in no way distracts the chef from his mission to turn fine dining into a true celebration, an on-going tribute to French cuisine. It is a joy to discover his emblematic artichoke and truffle soup on the menu, to be relished with brioche liberally spread with truffle butter.","11 quai de Conti, Paris, 75006, France",Paris, France,€€€€,"Creative, Modern Cuisine",2.3391955,48.8566248,33143804061,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/guy-savoy,https://www.guysavoy.com/,3 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Diners Club credit card,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Valet parking,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"

Finally with a place to call her own, she is committed heart and soul to this project. She cooks up a storm in three set menus composed of three, four or seven ""acts"". The dishes may appear simple but every last detail has been carefully considered (caviar, French toast, Pompadour apples) and the flavours come through loud and clear. She reprises some of her signature dishes, and we revel in pastry chef Pierre Chirac's top-notch desserts that are bursting with flavour, as in his Tahitian vanilla crème brûlée and Madagascan vanilla ice cream. There is a fine choice of wines by the glass served in magnum and even jeroboam... And it all comes together thanks to a team that runs like a well-oiled machine, from the kitchen to the front-of-house staff, to the attentive and friendly service. At lunchtime, you can eat in the bistro, where a tempting gourmet menu based on seasonal ingredients is served.","32 avenue Matignon, Paris, 75008, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Modern Cuisine,2.3143813,48.8720257,33142650561,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/la-scene,https://www.la-scene.paris/,2 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"

Greek chef Philip Chronopoulos officiates, after working at Joël Robuchon's Atelier (its Étoile location) and with Alain Passard. Using superb ingredients, he cooks up creative and striking cuisine, designing invigorating and remarkably mature recipes: fine mezze as an amuse-bouche, green bean salad with caviar and Isigny cream; or the fig, vanilla and elderflower millefeuille – a simply remarkable dessert.

It is located near the Champs-Élysées, a district the chef knows well, having worked at Ledoyen, Lasserre, Pierre Gagnaire, and Le Bristol. He has certainly found his feet in the kitchen. A true artist when it comes to combining produce from land and sea, he serves up highly personal cuisine with bold and distinct flavours – it never fails to deliver on what it promises.

This place has not failed to catch the imagination of wealthy foreign patrons, who come to soak up that certain Parisian je ne sais quoi. The Ducasse brand is cultivated by Amaury Bouhours, a loyal follower, with tasting menus comprised of small portions that pay homage to French tradition and the chef's creativity.

No stranger to top Parisian establishments (Bernard Pacaud, Alain Senderens), Jérôme Banctel has taken advantage of recent events to change course entirely. This Breton now invites his guests to partake in set menus (no choice) on a journey that revisits the flavours of Brittany and beyond, as inspired by his extensive travels, notably to Turkey. This reclaimed freedom unveils the chef’s genuine culinary identity, as he balances acidity, spices and seafood with the talent of a cosmopolitan alchemist. He prepares his dishes with superb ingredients (some of which you may never even have heard of, let alone tasted), never straying from his solid classical foundations. His lobster on a binchotan BBQ, almond pralines, peaches in verbena or his hake with morels in razor clam jus and green peas are truly out of this world.","La Réserve Paris, 42 avenue Gabriel, Paris, 75008, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Creative,2.3132078,48.8697309,33158366050,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/le-gabriel476630,https://www.lareserve-paris.com/,2 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Brunch,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Valet parking,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"

Dishes include saddle of lamb with green olives and chanterelles in pastry, or ""Taillevent tradition"" scampi black pudding.

In his open kitchen facing the customers, he is a charismatic orator, talking about his suppliers and his desire to take a back seat to the artisans who produce what he cooks – on that note, when it comes to either the recipes or the ingredients, the chef considers himself above all a ""middle man"". Everything is made to order, with garnishes and sauces designed with just one thing in mind: to elevate the ingredient without distorting it. The deliberately short menu presents atypical compositions (some with equally unusual names): homard à croquer presque vivant sur son rocher (""lobster so fresh it's practically alive on its rock""); red mullet Rossini (and its succulent sauce); pink praline tart made according to Henry Cornil's recipe for Alain Chapel.","3 rue de Prague, Paris, 75012, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Modern Cuisine,2.3759654,48.8486151,33143431226,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/table-bruno-verjus,https://table.paris/,2 MICHELIN Stars,"American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Diners Club credit card,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Visa credit card"

There is no carte but a tasting menu that tours the regions of France and revolves around Piège’s ""mijotés modernes"". This consummate chef demonstrates his creative talent and ability to provoke culinary emotion and taste without falling foul of the temptation to needlessly showcase his skills … He thus surprises us with a dish that is the epitome of simplicity, such as his succulent langoustine, seared on a Parisian paving stone and flanked by delicate seaweed and a buckwheat sabayon.","7 rue d'Aguesseau, Paris, 75008, France",Paris, France,€€€€,Creative,2.3193146,48.8701983,33153050000,https://guide.michelin.com/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/le-grand-restaurant-jean-francois-piege,https://jeanfrançoispiege.com/le-grand-restaurant,2 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"

A fine tribute to the two aviation pioneers, as well as to the sky over Paris! Perched above the rooftops and encased in glass, the restaurant feels like it is in flight over the capital, while the terrace offers a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacré Cœur.

Initially a Lyon-styled bistro, it was run by three generations of the Petit family, who nurtured its vintage charm and its woodwork, copper pots, mirrors, velvet banquettes and closely packed tables all reek of Belle Époque Paris. Everything down to the plates bears the B monogram, further adding to the authenticity of this bistro that is light years from the trendy boltholes of today. When the business changed hands and became part of the Ducasse Group in 2005, it lost none of its old-fashioned atmosphere.
