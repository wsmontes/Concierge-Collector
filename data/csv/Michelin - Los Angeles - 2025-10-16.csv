155,n/naka,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/n-naka,"Set in an attractive and neutral-toned dining room, the space holds a devoted reverence. It makes sense: guests don’t want to miss a morsel of Chef Niki Nakayama’s genius. Her clever creations are delightfully unbound by Japanese tradition; instead, she works within the spirit of it.
A nightly tasting menu might begin with a small glass of apple sake, followed by scallop tartare  with sanbaizu gelée, carrot purée, toasted sunflower seeds and crispy carrot chips. From there, tiny yet exquisite dishes pour forth, including grilled branzino with rich Santa Barbara sea urchin, shiitake mushrooms and ponzu; or a lobster dumpling with king crab bobbing in dashi. Al dente spaghettini with abalone slices, pickled cod roe and black truffle personifies her unique style.","3455 S.

161,Hayato,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/hayato,"With only one seating per night, this is the kind of destination where a handful of lucky diners are privy to an exemplary culinary spectacle. Many of the courses begin with ingredients that are attractively arranged, then finished before your eyes, and presented by Chef Brandon Hayato Go with detailed explanations. To kick off the kaiseki, the chef serves a small bite, or sakizuke, like chilled, charred eggplant with ginger and dashi. From there, it's a seasonal celebration artistically arranged on vintage Japanese pottery and porcelain collected by the chef. Local corn and sea scallops is transformed into kakiage; bonito is lightly smoked over rice bran straw; and miso-glazed black cod is folded into a luscious rice pot to conclude the meal.","1320 E. 7th St., Ste. 126, Los Angeles, 90021, USA",Los Angeles, USA,$$$$,"Japanese, Seafood",-118.2418788,34.0338072,12133950607,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/hayato,https://hayatorestaurant.com/,2 MICHELIN Stars,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Car park,Counter dining,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Notable sake list,Visa credit card"
702,715,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/715,"Originally from Osaka Prefecture, Chef Seigo Tamura came to the United States with dreams of becoming a professional basketball player. Thankfully for Los Angeles, the only points he's scoring are with diners savoring his sushi. Together with his younger brother, the two have followed in their sushi chef grandfather's footsteps. They source all seafood from Japan and age larger fish, such as tuna, in-house. Their blend of Hitomebore and Koshihikari rice is distinctive, and while Edomae-style sushi dictates using red vinegar for the rice, they add a little bit of sugar in a nod to their Osaka roots. Japanese hospitality reigns, with staff welcoming diners outside, and the chef seeing guests off personally at the conclusion of the meal.

707,Camphor,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/camphor,"This popular spot hums with activity from eager diners and a bustling open kitchen. Headed by uber-talented Chefs Max Boonthanakit and Lijo George, Camphor plates seriously good French fare with a sprinkle of spicing from Southeast Asia. Creative cocktails, including the refreshing Saint-Germain, complete the experience.
Bubbling hot rigatoni stuffed with artichokes, Swiss chard and Comte delivers one satisfying bite after the next, and steak au poivre arrives resting in a pool of perfect sauce. Expertly seared with a caramelized exterior, it is buttery and tender, but it is the Cognac cream infused with peppercorn that will have you sopping up every last bit. The seasonal fruit tart, whimsically deconstructed, is a stunner.","923 E. 3rd St., Ste. 109, Los Angeles, 90013, USA",Los Angeles, USA,$$$$,"French, Contemporary",-118.2433848,34.0485563,12136268888,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/camphor,https://www.camphor.la/,1 MICHELIN Star,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Counter dining,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Terrace,Valet parking,Visa credit card"
714,Q Sushi,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/q-sushi,"Authenticity and tradition are paramount in this extraordinary little sushiya. From the moment you walk in to the rapid succession of courses that follow, everything in this dining room seems steeped in a sense of calm. Meals typically begin with Chef Hiroyuki Naruke, who gracefully prepares every item and thoughtfully serves each diner. Edomae sushi arrives as an omakase of sublime fish, while other courses may commence with downright flawless sashimi and nigiri. Case in point—amberjack sashimi with onions and soy, where each morsel is sliced, seasoned and set before your eye. This may be tailed by such delicious nigiri as Hokkaido scallops, kohada and fatty tuna.
The pleasure of dining here extends right to the simple, spongy and fluffy block of tamago.","521 W. 7th St., Los Angeles, 90014, USA",Los Angeles, USA,$$$$,"Japanese, Sushi",-118.255844,34.046883,12132256285,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/q-sushi,https://www.qsushila.com/,1 MICHELIN Star,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Counter dining,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Mastercard credit card,Notable sake list,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"
722,Orsa & Winston,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/orsa-winston,"A counter and open kitchen showcase the culinary pyrotechnics of Chef Josef Centeno; and the deeply robust prix-fixe flaunts all the fireworks—think peak-season ingredients infused with wide-ranging flavors.
The menu is inspired by the culinary traditions of Japan and Italy. For starters, thin slices of geoduck are tossed with top-grade abalone, charred onion, nori oil and citrus for a refreshing, flavor-brimming feast. Binchotan-grilled sea bream brings spring into focus with vegetables like locally farmed rapini and pea leaves. Hand-torn pasta with porcini ""bolognese,"" lovage-dashi butter and salted shiso or the signature satsuki porridge with its moat of parmesan cream and rich Santa Barbara uni are standouts.","122 W. 4th St., Los Angeles, 90013, USA",Los Angeles, USA,$$$$,"Contemporary, Asian",-118.2479493,34.0484698,12136870300,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/orsa-winston,https://www.orsaandwinston.com/,1 MICHELIN Star,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Counter dining,Credit card / Debit card accepted,Diners Club credit card,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Valet parking,Visa credit card"
729,Manzke,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/manzke,"This eponymous fine dining concept from Walter and Margarita Manzke is in the same building as their more casual Bicyclette Bistro. Here, you'll settle in for a ten-course tasting menu boasting a contemporary style that blends French techniques with Californian influences and Asian notes. 
Ingenuity is everywhere. Wolfe Ranch quail is plated over steel-cut oats and served with a round of boudin blanc with a sauce of black truffle jus. Dover sole sided by a morel mushroom filled with porcini stuffing and sauce vin jaune is pure decadence. 
Dessert is equally inventive, as in the avocado panna cotta with passion fruit curd and coconut ice cream. The vintage cocktail program is a unique delight and a highly recommended start to any meal here.

738,Osteria Mozza,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/osteria-mozza,"A perennial hit since opening (expect a wait), this decade-old darling continues to please with creative cocktails and Italian cuisine. The décor veers from typical osteria-style, thanks to handsome dark-wood paneling and a white marble counter. The vibe is lively, but nab a seat at the Mozza bar for a prime view of the antipasti preparation.
Bread is something of an obsession here, as is the mozzarella menu. Chef Nancy Silverton's team strives to show you around the corners of Italian cooking, The crispy chicken leg is pure and simple comfort food, and pastas are unsurprisingly phenomenal—try the orecchiette with sausage and Swiss chard. Save room for desserts like torta della nonna with California honey from executive pastry chef, Dahlia Narvaez.

743,Shibumi,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/shibumi-559644,"There may be no more pleasurable place to learn about kappo-style cuisine, which has only recently made inroads into the American dining scene, than this stellar Japanese space, featuring a few tables and a counter crafted from a centuries-old cypress tree. The service is wonderfully engaging and attentive.
The multicourse kappo-style is the best way to experience this kitchen's creations. Dishes bring together a range of inspired Japanese flavors, but equal attention is given to texture and artistic presentations. Fixed menus here present a progression of courses selected by the chefs, which may include a few raw dishes. Highlights include wild fatty yellowtail with four-year-aged ginger and nori paste that packs a burst of umami.","815 S.

749,Kato,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/kato,"Chef Jonathan Yao steers the ship at Kato, deftly drawing from his Taiwanese background to create contemporary food that is at once simple and complex. Chef Yao is unafraid of change and often tweaks the menu based on availability or just his own whim. No matter, since you're in for a consistently creative and often quirky experience.
The dishes (some of which are made by a local artisan) are as elegant as they are inventive. Take the torn bluefin with caramelized onion set before you on a tiny pedestal, or the sea urchin donut with rich uni, hand cut jamon Iberico and brown butter. Warm and silky egg custard is punctuated by a kicky heat, thanks to kelp vinegar.

By night, Gwen opens into a glowing dining room showcasing the same upscale cuts à la carte and on its multicourse tasting. Named for their beloved grandmother, this collaboration between Chef Curtis Stone and his brother, Luke, conjures Art Deco glamour with crystal chandeliers and a roaring fireplace.
The menu is concise and stars house-made charcuterie and wood-fire grilled steaks. Watch from the chef's counter as the crew deftly cooks high quality meat, perhaps a Blackmore Wagyu New York strip, to perfection. Save room for dessert, like a round of cheesecake nestled in a mound of graham cracker crumbs and topped with a quenelle of mango lime sorbet.","6600 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, 90028, USA",Los Angeles, USA,$$$$,"Steakhouse, American",-118.3332968,34.0979419,13239467513,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/gwen,https://www.gwenla.com/,1 MICHELIN Star,"Air conditioning,American Express credit card,Counter dining,Mastercard credit card,Particularly interesting wine list,Terrace,Valet parking,Visa credit card,Wheelchair access"

The dining area's stark white walls are minimally accented with branches and ringed by track lighting, but the space is warmed by Chef Minh Phan's delightful presence. She tells compelling stories through her food and the menu complements the installation's ""Forest for the Trees"" theme. Items like house-preserved produce, produce-scrap sorbet and natural wines from female winemakers speak to the chef's distinct vision for fine-dining. A recent highlight was savory mochi made from local sweet rice stuffed with lardon and chrysanthemum, then wrapped in a fig leaf that's set aflame for a toasty treat.","516 S.

This clandestine (read: frustratingly difficult to find) sushi counter is in the most unexpected of places, but step inside this serene, minimalist showpiece and be transported to Japan. Great care is taken with every detail, whether it's the quality of ingredients or the artful plating—some of the pottery is even handmade by Chef Yoshiyuki Inoue. Highlights include stunning seared ocean perch tucked between a sheet of crisp nori; West Coast oyster braised in soy and served warm; and slightly smoked prawns coated in a lush egg yolk and soy sauce. The nigiri is excellent and tempura is also part of this experience where nothing is overlooked, even a bowl of simple-seeming miso soup.

764,Morihiro,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/morihiro,"As Chef Morihiro Onodera is one of the legends who helped establish LA's sushi culture, it comes as no surprise that his omakase is a standout. The little bites and dishes that precede the nigiri can often feel like a second thought at most counters, but that's far from the case here, where the omakase yields an impressive amount of food. His food is personal: the majority of the seafood comes from Toyosu; he uses Akitakomachi rice from his hometown of Iwate Prefecture; and all of the food is served on his handmade pottery. This meal is also original, fusing the style of cha-kaiseki with traditional omakase. Diners are treated to a parade of flavors ending with the richest, though tuna is clearly the star. Finish with matcha green tea and homemade sweets.

A large pergola-shaded patio is a clear destination when the weather is right. Beyond lies an equally ample dining room with vintage accents—like tufted leather banquettes and an L-shaped bar—which hint at the rustic yet contemporary menu.
This is open-flame cooking, rendered with a Southern twang and seasonal focus thanks to an abundance of local product. Rolls and biscuits should not be missed, while vegetable-based items, like collard greens with smoked turkey, speak of quality ingredients and delicious balance. Nuanced flavors and creativity unite in the likes of kampachi collar and pork belly.

True to its name, large flatscreen TVs showing the day’s game hang on every wall, and people do indeed come here to cheer on their team. The food is equally original, riffing on classic bar dishes but elevating them with astute seasoning and careful preparation. Onion rings are coated in dosa batter. Wings are marinated in cilantro-mint chutney. Rigatoni comes tossed in a creamy tomato masala that evokes a vodka tomato sauce. There are even thin, crisp pizzas.

The no-frills exterior and ambiguous name don’t suggest much, but once inside, discover a clean little contemporary space with whitewashed walls, artwork and—of course—stunningly good food that's meant to be enjoyed sans utensils.
These dishes are authentic and prepared with great care and attention; the menu ventures well past the region’s best-known items. Don’t miss the pan-fried freshwater trout, sumptuous chicken stew, and crumble-in-your-mouth teff cookies to close.

Made with dry-aged beef, caramelized onions and bacon compote, the elevated wares found in this kitchen are treasured as one of the country’s first (and perhaps finest) craft burgers. The market-driven menu goes on to include items that one would not expect from a pub—imagine an heirloom tomato salad with Persian cucumbers dressed in a sweetened basil-goat’s yogurt sauce; or even grilled skewers of deliciously spiced Sonoma lamb.

Flour tortillas are made in-house every day in full view of the dining room and boast a kind of richness and chew that others don’t. There are nearly 20 different burritos on offer, but everyone comes for the winning chile relleno. The tortilla is cooked on a griddle and then filled—not stuffed—with slivers of sweet poblano peppers and gooey cheese.

As casual as the vibe may seem, this is a serious kitchen dedicated to Asian cuisine. Be sure to try their vegetarian variations on classics such as pork-free mapo tofu, daikon dumplings and daily specials like the lotus root or seaweed salad. However, the cooking truly shines with Taiwanese specialties. The three-cup jidori chicken is its own simmering feast in a clay pot of dark meat with equal parts soy, sesame oil and rice wine reduced to a deep brown glaze, then studded with chopped green onion, dried chilies and whole garlic.

A tower of softly scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and American cheese arrives under a cloak of strawberry jam stacked between a fluffy cathead biscuit. It’s hearty and essential, much like the impressively airy hotcake crowned with ricotta, blueberry compote and pistachio.
Not everything is sweet at this charming café. In fact, some things are fried, like the hot fish sandwich inspired by Nashville’s hot chicken. Neat rows of cookies, pies and breads in the pastry case are yet another temptation from a restaurant that all but induces a nap.

Adding to that, its sunny-yellow exterior and orange canopy set a Mediterranean scene.
Make your way into this bright room donning bare wood tables and skylights. Pizzas are far above average, beginning with that unmistakable cornicione—perfect spots of char that rim the crust and bring the flavor. Toppings are just as fanciful, highlighting goat cheese, leeks and bacon; or maybe squash blossom with burrata.

This kitchen offers all-day dining, but with the shakshuka, or poached eggs in tomato stew, this isn’t your pancake and French toast crowd.
Dishes hail from Israel, Turkey, Iran and elsewhere and create harmonies that make the United Nations green with envy. From barbari bread to chicken and pine nut pies wrapped in flaky phyllo, you’ll be scraping your plate for crumbs.

A recent feature on Indo-Fijian cuisine included a creamy onion and coconut milk stew followed by a finely spiced goat pulao enlivened with cardamom, cloves and star anise. This is authentic homestyle cooking in the best of ways, a spotlight on undiscovered talent and a striking reminder of the many flavors the world has to offer.

Think fluffy whipped miso tofu, topped with marinated cherry tomatoes and pickled scallion kimchi; Salmon Creek Farm pork shumai with braised bacon dashi; and tender grilled chicken “oysters” kicked up with yuzu kosho. Dishes are meant to be shared and paired with beer or sake.

Lamb and pork kebabs cooked on long metal skewers are the main event, but appetizers easily hold their own. There might not be a better, creamier hummus around; this one boosted with smoked paprika, toasty pine nuts and an herby green zhoug.

Some mains may feature a simpler pairing of appetizing flavors, like fried fish served with chutney.

The offerings are extensive, but certain dishes jump off the page. Be sure to sample bubbling-hot Taepo chicken curry, rich with coconut milk, brightly flavored with turmeric and tender morning glory stems.

Equally ample is the menu, with all of the requisite standards, such as latkes, blintzes and chopped liver. Breakfast is served all day, but if you’re here for the first time, opt for the hot pastrami (provided by RC Provisions in Burbank) sandwich.

Originally from Vianópolis, Brazil, it's clear that hospitality runs through her veins. 
The chef's careful and skilled hand is evident in her food, which tastes of pure passion. The honest food transports diners to Brazil with dishes such as empadão de frango, a legendary chicken pot-pie. Nab the moqueca, a Brazilian seafood stew in a coconut sauce, if on offer, though the seafood bowl is a luscious alternative.

This careful process and that almighty oven shipped from Italy can be observed with longing through the glass-walled kitchen. The dining room also conjures the homeland through Mediterranean-blue murals and furnishings.
To top that crust, many pizzas go on to include premium ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes and fior di latte, which arrives several times a week from Italy. Alternatively, deck your pie with a more creative and locally minded blend of embellishments.

Stuffed with chestnuts, sweet potatoes, rice and herbs, then wrapped and roasted for hours, the bronzed beauty is plated before your eyes.

In fact, due to delicious summers spent in Emilia-Romagna, the chef's creations are a veritable ode to the region and promise to make Italian palates proud.
Quality ingredients and simple execution come to life in the grilled pork meatball spiedini over shaved fennel; and roasted spot prawn with breadcrumbs and parsley.

Run by the second generation of the Cetina family, it skews a bit younger than sibling Chichen Itza, with a sleek look, an open kitchen and a slightly higher (though still gentle) price point.
Though it anchors the Mercado La Paloma, a market hall focused on affordability for first-time business owners, this stall does have a few splurges up its sleeve. The one worth splashing on is the addictive ceviche of spanking-fresh wild sheepshead fish, Santa Barbara sea urchin and pico de gallo on a crisp tostada.","3655 S.

Of course, the crowd might actually be here for the food, because it’s that good. As the name suggests, the menu focuses on meat and seafood, like rabbit larb and hamachi tostada.

Tacos, ceviche and tostadas reign supreme on the menu, which draws culinary inspiration from the chef's childhood in Mexico City. Don’t miss the special tender chicken tacos—starring red mole made from bougainvillea and garnished with purple spinach and shaved red onion.
